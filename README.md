## Project Overview

**Love Never Fails** is developing *AI Advocate*, a mobile application designed to simplify California's legislative updates using artificial intelligence. The app will assist individuals, especially those who have experienced human or sexual trafficking, in understanding complex legal documents such as assembly and house bills. By offering AI-generated summaries that are accessible to people from all educational backgrounds, *AI Advocate* aims to empower users to engage with and advocate for the laws that affect them.
